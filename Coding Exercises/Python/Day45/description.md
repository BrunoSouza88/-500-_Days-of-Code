Add Numbers - Basic Operations
Introduction: In this challenge, you will create a function named addNumbers that performs the basic arithmetic operation of addition. The function will take two integers as input and return their sum.

Steps:

Define a function addNumbers which accepts two integers as its arguments.

Add the numbers together.

Return the result of the addition.

Requirements:

The function addNumbers should be defined in the Exercise class.

The function addNumbers should return an integer, the sum of the input parameters.

Input: Two integers num1 and num2.

Output: An integer that is the sum of num1 and num2.

Examples:

Exercise.addNumbers(10, 20); // Returns 30
Exercise.addNumbers(-10, -20); // Returns -30
Exercise.addNumbers(10, 0); // Returns 10
Exercise.addNumbers(-10, 10); // Returns 0
Constraints:

Both num1 and num2 can be any integer value, positive or negative.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1), since addition operation is constant time operation.

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1), no additional space is required.

Hint: Use the addition operator (+) in Java to add two numbers.

Note: Remember that in Java, the '+' operator is used for both addition and string concatenation. In this context, since num1 and num2 are both integers, the '+' operator will perform an addition operation.
