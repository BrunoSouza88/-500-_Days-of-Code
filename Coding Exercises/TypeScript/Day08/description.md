# Swap Two Numbers - Without Using Third Variable
## Introduction: In this challenge, you will implement a function named swapNumbers that swaps the values of two given numbers without using a third variable. You will utilize arithmetic operations to achieve this.

### Steps:

Define a function swapNumbers which accepts two integers, a and b.

Add b to a and assign the result back to a.

Subtract b from a and assign the result back to b.

Subtract b from a and assign the result back to a.

Return a and b in an array.

### Requirements:

The function swapNumbers should be defined in the Exercise class.

The function swapNumbers should return an array of two integers after swapping.

Input: Two integers a and b.

Output: An array of two integers [a, b] after swapping.

Examples:

Exercise.swapNumbers(10, 5); // Returns [5, 10]
Exercise.swapNumbers(2, -3); // Returns [-3, 2]
Exercise.swapNumbers(99, 0); // Returns [0, 99]
Exercise.swapNumbers(32, 32); // Returns [32, 32]
Constraints:

The integers can be negative, zero, or positive.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1), constant time complexity.

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1), constant space complexity.

### Hint: The arithmetic way to swap two numbers uses addition and subtraction to perform the swap without a third variable.

### Note: This method might lead to overflow for very large numbers because we perform an addition operation.
